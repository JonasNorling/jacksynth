JACK synth experiment
=====================

This is an experiment with building a sound synthesizer on JACK. Several oscillators, modulations and filters are implemented, with different degrees of maturity.


Building
========

sudo apt install --no-install-recommends libsndfile1-dev libjsoncpp-dev libgig-dev jackd1 libjack-dev
make


Playing
=======

Hook up a MIDI keyboard, use JACK to route MIDI and audio. Program change messages can be used to trigger presets, MIDI CC (Waldorf-like mapping) or sysex for parameter settings (see the files in patchpirate/ for a summary).


Evaluating performance
======================

Baudline is quite useful to draw realtime spectrograms, for rooting out aliasing and comparing to other synths.
